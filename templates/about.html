        Hello, my name is Amber Kirylak.  My experience with computers started out with Windows 3.1 where I was just a kid playing CD rom/DOS games like Put-Put, Freddy the Fish and much more.
        In my middle school years, I was introduced to the internet and the many doors that came along with it.  it was also the time when I first learned about Viruses, Trojans and Malware.
        During the 2020 Pandemic, I found the Harvard CS50 course as a way to challenge myself and learn a new skill in programing in todays world.  I hope I can learn more about Python and Flask and one day work in a field of programming or Cyber Security.
        My goal for 2022 is to study for CISSP.
        </p>
        <p>You can often find me working on Photoshop; retouching various types of photos from Weddings, Food and Architecture.</p>
        <p>My favorite food is Tacos (especially on Tuesday), and I always crave Chick-Fil-A on Sundays.</p>
